## Project Details

### 1. Healthcare Risk Classifier
Predicts diabetes/heart attack risk from anonymized clinical datasets.
- Advanced preprocessing, feature engineering, Optuna optimization, explainability (SHAP), and full deployment scripts.
- **Demo:** Model explainability dashboard for transparent predictions.

### 2. Real-Time Face Mask Detector
Deep learning computer vision for live detection of face masks in webcam/video streams.
- Implements MobileNet/CNN transfer learning, OpenCV, Flask for web deployment, real-time alerts.
- **Demo:** Streamlit/Flask video interface for testing.

### 3. Spam & Sentiment Analyzer
NLP app to classify emails/social media text for spam and sentiment.
- Naive Bayes, SVM, LSTM (Keras), Flask web interface for interactive classification.
- Handles imbalanced data, outputs predictions and analytics.

### 4. ETL Pipeline with Kafka
Data engineering pipeline for ingesting, transforming, and storing financial/sports event data.
- Kafka for streaming, Docker for isolated services, PostgreSQL for persistent analytics.
- Real-time and batch processing.

### 5. Terraform & Docker Automation
DevOps suite for automated cloud resource provisioning and CI/CD deployment.
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes), auto-scaling.
- Cloud-provider agnostic scripts.

### 6. Banking Fraud Detection App
AI application for real-time fraud detection and prevention in banking transactions.
- Real-time ingestion (Kafka), advanced ML (Random Forest, Isolation Forest, XGBoost), SHAP for explainability.
- Flask dashboard for alerts, Docker/Terraform cloud deployment, compliance-ready logging.
- End-to-end workflow with simulation, deployment scripts, and dashboards.
