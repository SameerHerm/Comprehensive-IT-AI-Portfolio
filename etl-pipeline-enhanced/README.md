# Enhanced ETL Data Pipeline with Shell, Airflow & Kafka 🚀

A production-ready ETL pipeline featuring real-time streaming, batch processing, data quality checks, and comprehensive monitoring using Apache Airflow, Kafka, and Shell scripting.

## Features ✨

- **Real-time Data Streaming**: Kafka-based streaming pipeline for real-time data processing
- **Batch Processing**: Scheduled batch ETL jobs with Apache Airflow
- **Data Quality Checks**: Automated validation and quality assurance
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Comprehensive pipeline monitoring with alerts
- **Scalable Architecture**: Docker-based deployment for easy scaling
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Support for files, APIs, and databases
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Data Versioning**: Track data lineage and versions

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configurations
3. Run setup script
Bash

chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh
4. Start services with Docker Compose
Bash

docker-compose up -d
5. Access services
Airflow UI: http://localhost:8080
Kafka UI: http://localhost:9000
Monitoring Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
Usage 📝
Running ETL Pipeline
Bash

# Start main ETL pipeline
./scripts/etl_processor.sh --mode batch --source file --target postgres

# Start streaming pipeline
python kafka/producers/data_producer.py
Using Airflow DAGs
Python

# Trigger DAG via CLI
airflow dags trigger etl_main_pipeline

# Or use the Airflow UI
Monitoring
Bash

# Check pipeline status
./scripts/monitoring.sh status

# View logs
./scripts/monitoring.sh logs --component airflow
